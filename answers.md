1. How many times would the body of this nested for loop execute? 
	for (int row = 7; row < 17; row++)
         for (int col = 6; col < 15; col++)
~80 times (10 rows and 8 columns) - you multiply them together to see how many times the program has to go through the loops
         
2. How many times would the body of this nested for loop execute?
       for (int row = 5; row <= 11; row++)
         for (int col = 3; col <= 18; col++)
~112 times (7 rows and 16 columns) - you multiply them together to see how many times the program has to go through the loops
